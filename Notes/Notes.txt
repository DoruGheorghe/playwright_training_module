Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and webKit with a single API. Built to enable cross-browser web testing.


In VS Code, install Playwright extension. Press ctr+shift+P and type install Playwright. Install browsers deps for Chromium, Firefox and Safari.
By default, tests are ran headless. To change this, from the playwright.config. ts, set:
use: {
    headless: false,
      },

In JavaScript, the ? is called the optional chaining operator. It is used to access properties of an object when it's uncertain whether
 the object or any of its nested properties are null or undefined. If the property or method exists, it is accessed normally.
  If the property or method does not exist, instead of throwing an error, undefined is returned.
